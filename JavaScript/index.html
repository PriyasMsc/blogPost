	<h2>Closures</h2>
	<p>A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables scope chain. The
		closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets),
		it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

		The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s
		parameters. Note that the inner function cannot call the outer function’s arguments object, however, even though
		it can call the outer function’s parameters directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even
		after the outer function has returned.
	</p>
	<p>
		A function can return another function in JavaScript. A function which is assigned to a variable is called
		function expression
	</p>
	<p>Find the example below:</p>
	<pre class="preTag">
    // Write Javascript code!
    function showName(firstName, lastName) {
      var nameIntro = "My name is ";
      // this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameter
      function makeFullName() {
        return nameIntro + firstName + " " + lastName;
      }

      return makeFullName();
    }

    document.getElementById("closure").innerHTML = showName("Priyanga", "Subrmaniam"); // Your name is Michael Jackson
      
	<b>OutPut: </b><i id="closure"></i>
  </pre>

	<h2>Hoisting</h2>
	<p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope
		before code execution.
